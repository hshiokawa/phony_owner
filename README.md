Phony Owner: Detecting Phone Theft Using Walking Patterns

This is the main code used for my project at Insight Data Science
Fellowship Program.  The code takes in time series walking activity
data measured by smartphones' accelerometer and checks if the walking
pattern matches with the phone's owner.  It utilizes machine learning
methods such as K-Nearest Neighbor and Supported Vector Machine.
It achieved 100% accuracy in distinguishing my and 11 other personsâ€™
accelerometer data obtained from flat surface indoor walking activity,
and F1-Score=0.85 for data obtained from on street walking activity.
